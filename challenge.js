/**
 * Create an array called 'persons' with 5 objects. Each object should have firstname, lastname, and age properties. You can assign any values.
 * 
 * Create a global function called oldestPerson that accepts an array as the parameter. Your function should be able to check and return the oldest person from the array based on their age.
 * 
 * Print the output using template literal.
 * 
 * 
 * Sample code:
 * 
 * let persons = [
 *  {"John", "Doe", 25},
 *  {"Jane", "Doe", 30},
 *  {"Joe", "Dough", 26},
 *  {"Jack", "Dude", 28},
 *  {"Julie", "Donna", 22}
 * ]
 * 
 * function oldestPerson(list) {
 *    // code
 * }
 * 
 * let oldest = oldestPerson(persons)
 * console.log(`The oldest person is ${oldest}.`) // The oldest person is Jane Doe.
 * 
 * 
 * BONUS: On your function, calculate the year of birth by subtracting age with the year today. Afterwards, return the year alongside the name to include on your console.log (You can return an object and use dot notation!)
